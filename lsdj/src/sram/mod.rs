//! LittleSoundDJ SRAM/`.sav` file handling
//!
//! This module contains code for manipulating [`SRam`], which is where LSDJ stores our
//! songs (compressed and uncompressed). Usually people work with `.sav` files, which gameboy
//! emulators use to store the SRAM tied to a ROM. You can also download/upload `.sav`
//! files to flashcarts for playback on real hardware.

/// A full representation of LittleSoundDJ SRAM
///
/// Every LSDJ save file consists of the same amount of bytes, in which both the song you're
/// currently working on is stored (uncompressed), as well as a filesystem containing at max
/// 32 (compressed) songs.
///
/// The first time you boot LSDJ it formats the SRAM to the expected structure, setting some
/// magic bytes for later verification as well. This crate allows you to do the same, but also
/// to deserialize [`SRam`] from disk or an arbitrary reader.
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use lsdj::sram::SRam;
/// # use std::fs::File;
/// // Construct valid SRAM with the default/empty song and an empty filesystem
/// let sram = SRam::new();
///
/// // Load SRAM from a path on disk
/// let sram = SRam::from_path("bangers.sav")?;
///
/// // Load SRAM from an arbitrary reader
/// let sram = SRam::from_reader(File::open("bangers.sav")?)?;
/// # Ok::<(), anyhow::Error>(())
/// ```
///
/// In the same way, SRAM can be serialized back to the underlying byte structure:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use lsdj::sram::SRam;
/// # use std::fs::File;
/// # let sram = SRam::new();
/// // Load SRAM from a path on disk
/// sram.to_path("bangers.sav")?;
///
/// // Load SRAM from an arbitrary reader
/// sram.to_writer(File::create("bangers.sav")?)?;
/// # Ok::<(), std::io::Error>(())
/// ```
